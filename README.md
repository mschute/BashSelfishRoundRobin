A simple Bash script simulating a Selfish Round Robin CPU scheduling algorithm. This project implements a custom scheduling algorithm where processes are scheduled in a round-robin fashion, but with a selfish twistâ€”processes may prioritize themselves based on specific conditions.

Features

- Simulates a CPU scheduling algorithm with adjustable parameters.
- Selfish behavior allows processes to influence scheduling priority.
- Lightweight and written entirely in Bash.
